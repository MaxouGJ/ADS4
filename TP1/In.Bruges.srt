No.

170
00:14:45,297 --> 00:14:47,547
I'll tell you what I am
at dinner tomorrow night.

171
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,672
(CHUCKLING)

172
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:05,463
F***.

173
00:15:18,462 --> 00:15:20,253
How f***ing cool.

174
00:15:31,335 --> 00:15:33,127
Mr Blakely?

175
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,919
Yes. No, Mr Cranham.
No. Yes. Mr Blakely. Yes.

176
00:15:39,793 --> 00:15:41,668
You have a message.

177
00:15:46,918 --> 00:15:48,044
Shit!

178
00:15:48,918 --> 00:15:52,084
<i>HARRY: Number one, whyaren't you in
when I f***ing told you to be in?</i>

179
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:55,293
<i>Number two, whydoesn't this hotel
have phones with f***ing voicemail</i>

180
00:15:55,376 --> 00:15:58,126
<i>and not I have to leave messages
with the f***ing receptionist?</i>

181
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:01,084
<i>Number three, you better f***ing be in
tomorrow night when I f***ing call again</i>

182
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:05,292
<i>or there'll be f***ing Hell to pay,
I'm f***ing telling you. Harry.</i>

183
00:16:29,248 --> 00:16:30,582
(DOOR LOCK TURNING)

184
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,998
Would you turn the f***ing light off!

185
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:46,581
Sorry, Ken.

186
00:16:46,664 --> 00:16:48,789
Keep the f***ing noise down!

187
00:16:51,956 --> 00:16:53,748
Someone's in a mood.

188
00:17:08,163 --> 00:17:09,246
(SOFTLY) You'll never guess what.

189
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,413
Will you shut your f***ing mouth, please,
and go to sleep?

190
00:17:11,496 --> 00:17:13,163
Oh, sorry.

191
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:20,662
Except I've gotta take me contact lenses out.

192
00:17:27,745 --> 00:17:29,244
Altogether,

193
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:30,745
I had

194
00:17:32,077 --> 00:17:34,995
five pints of beer and six bottles.

195
00:17:36,537 --> 00:17:40,786
No. Six pints of beer and seven bottles.

196
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,494
And you know what? I'm not even pissed!

197
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:51,577
You'll never guess what, Ken.

198
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:55,410
- Ken, you'll never guess what.
- What?

199
00:17:55,493 --> 00:17:57,744
- Got a date for tomorrow night.
- I'm very happy for you.

200
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,327
- With a girl.
- Can you turn the light off, please?

201
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,243
Only been in Bruges one day,
got a date with a girl in the film business,

202
00:18:03,327 --> 00:18:05,409
the Belgian film business.

203
00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:09,201
They're doing a film about a midget.

204
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:28,657
Miss?

205
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,657
Marie?

206
00:18:33,908 --> 00:18:38,325
Sorry about the message last night.
The man who left it is a bit of a...

207
00:18:39,782 --> 00:18:41,782
Well, he's a bit of a...

208
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:43,491
Cock?

209
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,699
Yes. He's a bit of a cock.

210
00:18:49,948 --> 00:18:51,199
Morning.

211
00:19:00,448 --> 00:19:02,448
Harry called last night.

212
00:19:03,072 --> 00:19:04,615
We missed him.

213
00:19:07,405 --> 00:19:09,906
Jeez, he swears a lot, doesn't he?

214
00:19:11,072 --> 00:19:14,155
We're staying in tonight. Whatever happens.

215
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:15,779
Hmm.

216
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,613
Except...

217
00:19:21,155 --> 00:19:22,571
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

218
00:19:22,654 --> 00:19:24,237
Except "hmm" what?

219
00:19:24,321 --> 00:19:29,070
Except only one of us
needs to stay in, really.

220
00:19:31,945 --> 00:19:34,613
And which one of us
would that be, now, Ray?

221
00:19:34,696 --> 00:19:37,987
- I thought you didn't like Bruges.
- I don't like Bruges, it's a shithole.

222
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,862
But I did already say
I had a date with a Belgian lady

223
00:19:41,945 --> 00:19:45,987
in the Belgian film business,
which I did already say about before.

224
00:19:50,445 --> 00:19:53,195
Just don't get into any f***ing trouble.

225
00:19:53,278 --> 00:19:55,361
We're keeping a low profile.

226
00:19:55,986 --> 00:20:02,152
And this morning, and this afternoon,
we are doing what I want to do.

227
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:03,985
- Got it?
- Of course.

228
00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:06,735
Which, I presume, will involve culture.

229
00:20:06,818 --> 00:20:10,526
Oh, we shall strike a balance
between culture and fun.

230
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:15,193
Somehow I believe, Ken, that the balance
shall tip in the favour of culture.

231
00:20:16,193 --> 00:20:20,026
Like a big, fat,
f***ing retarded, f***ing black girl

232
00:20:20,109 --> 00:20:22,817
on a seesaw, opposite

233
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:27,817
a dwarf.

234
00:20:57,732 --> 00:21:00,149
(DRAGGING FEET)

235
00:21:03,857 --> 00:21:08,023
(SOFTLY) Ray, did we or did we not agree
that if I let you go on your date tonight,

236
00:21:08,106 --> 00:21:10,023
we'd do the things I wanted to do today?

237
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:11,981
We are doing the things
that you wanted to do today.

238
00:21:12,065 --> 00:21:14,606
And that we'd do them
without you throwing a f***ing moody,

239
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:17,023
like some 5-year-old
who's dropped all his sweets?

240
00:21:17,106 --> 00:21:19,064
I didn't agree to that.

241
00:21:19,856 --> 00:21:22,022
I'll cheer up. I'll cheer up.

242
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:25,397
Up there, the top altar, is a phial

243
00:21:26,189 --> 00:21:29,688
brought back by a Flemish knight
from the Crusades in the Holy Land.

244
00:21:29,772 --> 00:21:32,355
And that phial,
do you know what it's said to contain?

245
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:33,979
No, what's it said to contain?

246
00:21:34,063 --> 00:21:38,022
It's said to contain
some drops of Jesus Christ's blood.

247
00:21:38,105 --> 00:21:41,813
Yeah, that's how this church got its name.
Basilica of the Holy Blood.

248
00:21:41,897 --> 00:21:43,229
Yeah. Yeah.

249
00:21:43,313 --> 00:21:46,188
And this blood, right,
though it's dried blood,

250
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:50,355
at different times over many years,
they say it turned back into liquid.

251
00:21:50,438 --> 00:21:53,063
Turned back into liquid from dried blood.

252
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,270
At various times of great

253
00:21:56,854 --> 00:21:58,103
stress.

254
00:21:58,187 --> 00:21:59,479
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

255
00:21:59,562 --> 00:22:04,645
So, yeah, I'm gonna go up in the queue
and touch it, which is what you do.

256
00:22:04,728 --> 00:22:06,853
- Yeah?
- Yeah. You coming?

257
00:22:07,895 --> 00:22:09,394
Do I have to?

258
00:22:10,936 --> 00:22:13,852
Do you have to?
Of course you don't have to.

259
00:22:13,936 --> 00:22:17,810
It's Jesus' f***ing blood, isn't it?
Of course you don't f***ing have to!

260
00:22:17,894 --> 00:22:20,393
Of course you don't f***ing have to!

261
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:06,266
You little f***ing cunt.

murder someone, Raymond?</i>

265
00:23:46,388 --> 00:23:48,472
For money, Father.

For money?

267
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:54,347
- You murdered someone for money?
- Yes, Father.

268
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:57,679
Not out of anger, not out of nothing.
For money.

(CLEARS THROAT)

270
00:24:00,346 --> 00:24:02,930
Who did you murder for money, Raymond?

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,095
You, Father.

272
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,346
I'm sorry?

273
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:11,095
I said you, Father. What, are you deaf?

274
00:24:11,512 --> 00:24:13,512
Harry Waters says hello.

275
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,344
The little boy.

276
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:20,962
RAY: I quite like this one.

277
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:25,295
All the rest were rubbish by spastics,
but this one's quite good.

278
00:26:25,379 --> 00:26:27,379
What's that all about, then?

279
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:32,378
- It's Judgement Day, you know?
- Oh, yeah.

280
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:41,128
- What's that then?
- Well, it's, you know, the final day on Earth.

281
00:26:41,836 --> 00:26:46,836
When mankind will be judged for
all the crimes they've committed and that.

282
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:51,835
And see who gets into Heaven
and who gets into Hell and all that?

283
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,002
Yeah.

284
00:26:53,086 --> 00:26:56,169
- And what's the other place?
- Purgatory.

285
00:26:56,252 --> 00:26:58,502
Purgatory?

286
00:26:58,585 --> 00:27:01,669
Purgatory's kind of like
the in-betweeny one.

287
00:27:01,752 --> 00:27:05,709
You weren't really shit,
but you weren't all that great, either.

288
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:07,876
Like Tottenham.

289
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:11,292
Do you believe in all that stuff, Ken?

290
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:12,834
About Tottenham?

291
00:27:12,918 --> 00:27:15,292
The Last Judgement and the afterlife.

292
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,250
Guilt and sins and

293
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,500
Hell and all that?

294
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:43,250
KEN: I don't know, Ray.
I don't know what I believe.

295
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:47,083
The things you're taught as a child,
they never really leave you, do they?

296
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,415
So, like, I believe
in trying to lead a good life.

297
00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:53,165
Like, if there's an old lady,
carrying her shopping home,

298
00:27:53,249 --> 00:27:56,957
I don't try and help her carry her shopping,
I don't go that far,

299
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,207
but I'll certainly hold the door open for her
and that, and let her go out before me.

300
00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:03,414
Yeah. And anyway, if you tried
to help her carry her shopping,

301
00:28:03,498 --> 00:28:05,414
she'd probably think
you were just trying to nick her shopping.

302
00:28:05,498 --> 00:28:08,331
- Exactly.
- This is the world we live in today.

303
00:28:08,414 --> 00:28:11,705
At the same time
as trying to lead a good life,

304
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:17,413
I have to reconcile myself with the fact
that, yes, I have killed people.

305
00:28:18,372 --> 00:28:21,913
Not many people.
Most of them were not very nice people.

306
00:28:22,455 --> 00:28:24,621
Apart from one person.

307
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:28,579
- Who's that?
- This fellow, Danny Aliband's brother.

308
00:28:28,663 --> 00:28:32,120
He was just trying to protect his brother.
Like you or I would.

309
00:28:32,204 --> 00:28:34,497
He was just a lollipop man.

310
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,996
He came at me with a bottle.
What are you gonna do?

311
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,704
I shot him down.

312
00:28:41,246 --> 00:28:45,037
In my book, though, sorry,
someone comes at you with a bottle,

313
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,662
that is a deadly weapon,
he's gotta take the consequences.

314
00:28:47,745 --> 00:28:49,162
I know that in my heart.

315
00:28:49,246 --> 00:28:51,495
I also know that he was just trying
to protect his brother, you know?

316
00:28:51,578 --> 00:28:55,203
I know. But a bottle, that can kill you.
It's a case of it's you or him.

317
00:28:55,286 --> 00:28:57,161
If he'd come at you with his bare hands,
that'd be different.

318
00:28:57,245 --> 00:28:58,286
That wouldn't have been fair.

319
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,702
Well, technically,
your bare hands can kill somebody, too.

320
00:29:00,786 --> 00:29:03,577
They can be deadly weapons, too.
I mean, what if he knew karate, say?

321
00:29:03,661 --> 00:29:06,786
- You said he was a lollipop man.
- He was a lollipop man.

322
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:09,035
What's a lollipop man doing
knowing f***ing karate?

323
00:29:09,118 --> 00:29:10,202
I'm just saying.

324
00:29:10,285 --> 00:29:12,827
- How old was he?
- About 50.

325
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,327
What's a 50-year-old lollipop man doing
knowing f***ing karate?

326
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:17,785
What was he, a Chinese lollipop man?

327
00:29:17,868 --> 00:29:20,952
Jesus, Ken, I'm trying to talk about...

328
00:29:29,325 --> 00:29:31,242
I know what you're trying to talk about.

329
00:29:31,325 --> 00:29:34,618
I killed a little boy.
You keep bringing up f***ing lollipop men!

330
00:29:34,701 --> 00:29:38,493
- You didn't mean to kill a little boy.
- I know I didn't mean to.

331
00:29:40,492 --> 00:29:44,034
But because of the choices I made
and the course that I put into action,

332
00:29:44,118 --> 00:29:46,367
a little boy isn't here any more.

333
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,659
And he'll never be here again.

334
00:29:53,283 --> 00:29:56,282
I mean here in the world,
not here in Belgium.

As we were walking through the streets,

hanging over everything,

00:41:17,407 --> 00:41:21,198
and it made it look almost like a fairytale
or something.

507

And he turned to me,
do you know what he said?

508
00:41:22,866 --> 00:41:24,449

509

but I feel like I'm in a dream."</i>

to give him something.</i>

One instance of her hand on my cock
and my finger up her thing,

00:52:20,408 --> 00:52:22,617
JIMMY: You don't decide this shit, man.

660
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,575
Well, who are the half-castes
gonna fight with?

661
00:52:24,658 --> 00:52:27,325
The blacks, man. That's obvious.

662
00:52:27,408 --> 00:52:29,824
But what about the Pakistanis?

663
00:52:30,908 --> 00:52:33,532
- The blacks.
- What about...

664
00:52:34,533 --> 00:52:36,075
Think of a hard one.

665
00:52:37,033 --> 00:52:40,616
- What about the Vietnamese?
- The blacks!

666
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:45,240
Well, I'm definitely fighting with the blacks
if they've got the Vietnamese.

667
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:50,740
So, hang on.

668
00:52:51,657 --> 00:52:53,407
Would all of the white midgets
in the world be fighting

669
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:56,740
- against all the black midgets in the world?
- Yeah.

670
00:52:57,448 --> 00:52:59,573
That would make a good film!

671
00:53:00,448 --> 00:53:05,198
You don't know how much shit
I've had to take off of black midgets, man.

672
00:53:05,739 --> 00:53:07,031
That's...

673
00:53:08,614 --> 00:53:10,364
Undeniably true.

674
00:53:10,447 --> 00:53:11,906
See, Jimmy,

675
00:53:13,405 --> 00:53:15,072
my wife was black.

676
00:53:16,655 --> 00:53:18,696
And I loved her very much.

677
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:24,780
And in 1976,
she was murdered by a white man.

678
00:53:26,488 --> 00:53:30,654
So, where the f*** am I supposed to stand
in all this blood and carnage?

679
00:53:32,237 --> 00:53:34,571
Did they get the guy who did it?

680
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:38,237
- A friend of mine got him.
- Harry Waters got him.

681
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:44,612
So tell me, Jim, whose side do I fight on
in this wonderful war?

682
00:53:47,695 --> 00:53:50,737
I think you need
to weigh up all your options

683
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:54,403
and let your conscience decide, Ken.

684
00:54:03,611 --> 00:54:07,735
Two manky hookers and a racist dwarf.

685
00:54:08,236 --> 00:54:11,902
- I think I'm heading home.
- Yeah. I think I'll come with you.

686
00:54:13,735 --> 00:54:16,735
- What's...
- Back off, shorty!

687
00:54:16,818 --> 00:54:18,859
You don't know karate.

688
00:54:18,943 --> 00:54:21,901
- Don't say you didn't have it coming.
- Don't say you didn't have it coming.

689
00:54:21,984 --> 00:54:23,276
Shortarse!

690
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:52,604
- Meeting Yuri.
- Yes, I'm Yuri.

691
00:56:22,185 --> 00:56:24,935
Mr Waters said that might be necessary.

692
00:56:28,143 --> 00:56:31,601
There are a lot of alcoves
in the Koningin Astrid Park.

693
00:56:32,518 --> 00:56:34,727
You use this word, "alcoves"?

694
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:37,768
"Alcoves"? Yes. Sometimes.

695
00:56:37,851 --> 00:56:41,976
There are not many people around
in these alcoves in Christmastime.

696
00:56:42,518 --> 00:56:45,851
If I were to murder a man,
I would murder him here.

697
00:56:48,601 --> 00:56:51,559
Are you sure
this is the right word, "alcoves"?

698
00:56:51,643 --> 00:56:55,267
<i>"Alcoves," yes.
It's kind of like "nooks and crannies."</i>

699
00:56:55,351 --> 00:56:59,433
"Nooks and crannies," yes.
Perhaps this would be more accurate.

700
00:56:59,517 --> 00:57:02,933
<i>"Nooks and crannies," rather than "alcoves."
Yeah.</i>

701
00:57:09,265 --> 00:57:13,682
You are going to do it, aren't you?
Mr Waters will be very disappointed...

702
00:57:13,766 --> 00:57:16,349
Of course I'm going to f***ing do it.

703
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:19,432
It's what I do.

704
00:57:25,723 --> 00:57:28,972
Your friend was behaving rather oddly
this morning.

705
00:57:36,473 --> 00:57:37,973
Oddly? How?

706
00:57:38,056 --> 00:57:42,181
Well, he asked me about the baby,
and if I wanted a boy or a girl.

707
00:57:43,014 --> 00:57:46,430
I said I didn't mind
as long as it's healthy, of course.

708
00:57:46,514 --> 00:57:50,806
But then he gave me 200 euros
to give to the baby.

709
00:57:52,305 --> 00:57:57,222
I refused, obviously,
but he was quite insistent.

710
00:57:59,055 --> 00:58:02,137
Would you give it back to him
when you see him?

711
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:06,887
I don't want to appear ungrateful,
but it seemed like all the money he had.

712
00:58:06,971 --> 00:58:10,971
- Do you know where he is now?
- He said he was going to the park.

713
00:59:10,467 --> 00:59:11,841
Sorry, Ray.

714
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:15,133
I'm sorry.

715
00:59:45,799 --> 00:59:46,965
Ray, don't!

716
00:59:47,048 --> 00:59:49,631
F***ing hell!
Where the f*** did you come from?

717
00:59:49,714 --> 00:59:52,714
I was behind the thing.
What the f*** are you doing, Ray?

718
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:55,422
- What the f*** are you doing?
- Nothing.

719
00:59:55,506 --> 00:59:57,548
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

720
00:59:57,631 --> 00:59:59,005
Oh, my God!

721
01:00:01,047 --> 01:00:03,630
- You were gonna kill me.
- No, I wasn't.

722
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:06,296
You were gonna kill yourself!

723
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:11,463
- I'm allowed to.
- No, you're not!

724
01:00:11,547 --> 01:00:12,630
What?

725
01:00:13,213 --> 01:00:16,129
I'm not allowed to and you are?
How's that fair?

726
01:00:23,295 --> 01:00:26,504
Can we go somewhere
and talk about this, please?

727
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:31,878
I wasn't gonna go through with it, Ray.

728
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:36,003
You f***ing looked like
you were gonna go f***ing through with it.

729
01:00:38,045 --> 01:00:41,420
- Where'd you get that gun?
- A friend of Harry's.

730
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:42,837
F***, man.

731
01:00:45,461 --> 01:00:46,962
Let me see it.

732
01:00:50,961 --> 01:00:52,461
Silencer, too.

733
01:00:55,002 --> 01:00:56,086
Nice.

734
01:01:01,669 --> 01:01:03,960
Mine's a bloody girl's gun.

735
01:01:13,084 --> 01:01:15,584
- I'm keeping it.
- Pardon me?

736
01:01:17,834 --> 01:01:20,126
- Give me me gun back.
- You're not getting it back.

737
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:21,334
You're a suicide case.

738
01:01:21,416 --> 01:01:24,126
And you were trying to shoot me
in the f***ing head.

739
01:01:24,208 --> 01:01:25,750
You're not getting that gun back.

740

and we're still in f***ing Bruges.

743
01:01:36,667 --> 01:01:40,999
Listen, I'm gonna give you some money
and put you on a train somewhere.

744
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:42,417
Back to England?

745
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:45,541
You can't go back to England, Ray.
You'd be a dead man!

746

(CRYING) I want to be a dead man.
Have you been missing something?

747

You don't want to be a dead man, Ray.

748
01:01:56,207 --> 01:01:58,082
I killed a little boy!

749
01:02:12,164 --> 01:02:14,372
Then save the next little boy.

750
01:02:15,831 --> 01:02:17,872
Just go away somewhere,

751
01:02:18,622 --> 01:02:22,038
get out of this business
and try to do something good.

752
01:02:23,163 --> 01:02:25,663
You're not gonna help anybody dead.

753
01:02:26,205 --> 01:02:28,830
You're not gonna bring that boy back.

754
01:02:30,912 --> 01:02:33,246
But you might save the next one.

755
01:02:34,746 --> 01:02:36,996
What am I gonna be, a doctor?

756
01:02:37,663 --> 01:02:39,246
You need exams.

757
01:02:40,038 --> 01:02:42,663

this whole being in Bruges thing,

761
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:13,743
was just to give you
one last, joyful memory before you died.

- What am I gonna do?
- Just keep moving.

Keep on moving.

773

Try not to think about it.

774
01:04:00,157 --> 01:04:03,657
- Learn a new language, maybe?
- Sure, I can hardly do English.

That's one thing
I like about Europe, though.

any of their languages.

- The alcoves.

Ray did?

853
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:34,422
I was trying to rob him
and he took my gun from me.

854
01:11:35,755 --> 01:11:39,796
And the gun was full of blanks,
and he shot the blank into my eye.

855
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:45,463
And now, I cannot see from this eye
ever again, the doctors say.

856

Well, to be honest,
it sounds like it was all your fault.

What?

858
01:11:50,754 --> 01:11:53,462
I mean, basically, if you're robbing a man
and you're only carrying blanks,

859
01:11:53,545 --> 01:11:55,462
and you allow your gun to be taken off you,

860
01:11:55,545 --> 01:11:57,754
and you allow yourself
to be shot in the eye with a blank,

861

for which I assume the person
has to get quite close to you, then,

862

yeah, really, it's all your fault
for being such a poof.

I do want the guy dead.
I want him f***ing crucified.

"Ken, will you do me a favour
and become Ray's psychiatrist, please?"

875
01:13:52,496 --> 01:13:56,954
No. What I think I asked you was, "Could
you go blow his f***ing head off for me?"

876
01:13:57,038 --> 01:13:59,038
"He's suicidal"?

877
01:13:59,121 --> 01:14:02,621
I'm suicidal. You're suicidal.
Everybody's f***ing suicidal!

878
01:14:02,704 --> 01:14:04,871
We don't all keep going on about it!

879
01:14:04,954 --> 01:14:09,287
Has he killed himself yet? No.
So he's not f***ing suicidal, is he?

880
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:11,786
He put a loaded gun to his head
this morning. I stopped him.

881
01:14:11,870 --> 01:14:14,369
He... What? This gets f***ing worse!

01:14:15,286 --> 01:14:16,369
We were down in the park...

883
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:20,411
Let me get this right.
You were down in the park?

884
01:14:20,494 --> 01:14:22,620
What's that got to do with f***ing anything?

885
01:14:22,702 --> 01:14:25,535
Let me get this right.
Not only have you refused to kill the boy,

886
01:14:25,619 --> 01:14:27,785
you've even stopped the boy
from killing himself,

887
01:14:27,869 --> 01:14:30,452
which would have solved my problem,
which would have solved your problem,

888
01:14:30,535 --> 01:14:32,452
which sounds like
it would've solved the boy's problem.

889
01:14:32,535 --> 01:14:34,119
It wouldn't have solved his problem.

890
01:14:34,202 --> 01:14:38,161
Ken, if I had killed a little kid,
accidentally or otherwise,

891
01:14:38,244 --> 01:14:39,452
I wouldn't have thought twice.

892
01:14:39,535 --> 01:14:42,077
I'd have killed myself on the f***ing spot.
On the f***ing spot.

893
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:44,785
I'd have stuck the gun in me mouth
on the f***ing spot!

you're gonna become an even bigger cunt.

- If you go outside and round the corner,
